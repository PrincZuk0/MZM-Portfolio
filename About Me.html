        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>What draws me to web development is simple: I like building things that work. There&apos;s something addictive about taking an idea, writing the logic behind it, <br>
            and watching it come to life in a browser. It&apos;s a mix of creativity and problem&ndash;solving that fits the way my brain works — structured, curious, <br>
            and always looking for a better way to do something.<br>
            I enjoy learning new tools, breaking down problems, and figuring out why something isn&apos;t behaving the way it should. That process doesn&apos;t frustrate me; it motivates me. <br>
            Every bug fixed or feature completed feels like progress, and that&apos;s what keeps me pushing to improve.<br>
            What I bring to a team is reliability, focus, and a genuine drive to grow. I take pride in writing clean, understandable code and in thinking about how real users will interact with what I build. <br>
            I&apos;m not afraid to ask questions, experiment, or take ownership of my work. I want to contribute to projects that matter and become someone people can trust to deliver.<br>
            I&apos;m committed, adaptable, and genuinely passionate about becoming a strong developer — and I&apos;m ready to put in the work to be an asset to whoever gives me the opportunity.<br>
